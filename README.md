## Introduction ##

Welcome to the Interactive Lighting project overview! Our team was tasked with creating an immersive lighting system for a gaming room, offering users various interaction options that dynamically alter the lighting patterns based on in-game actions and ambient sound.

## What's our goal? ##

We were given the task to make lighting for a gaming room that users can interact with in different ways. This will affect the coloring and patern of the lighting.

## How does it work? ##

We use multiple led strips that are connected to the gaming setup and these will project different lighting paterns depending on what sound is made in the game you're playing. 

## Features ##
* Real-time Responsiveness: The lighting system reacts instantly to in-game events and ambient sound, providing a seamless and immersive experience.

## Expandability ##



## Software we used ##

* Arduino: For programming the microcontroller and controlling the LED strips.
* WLED: A versatile software library for controlling LED strips, offering various effects and customization options.
* Fusion 360: Used for designing and prototyping the physical components of the lighting system.

## Hardware we used ##

* ESP32: A powerful microcontroller providing ample processing power and connectivity options.
* 24V Power Supply: To provide the necessary power for the LED strips and other components.
* DC/DC Converter: Ensures efficient power conversion and regulation.
* WS2812 LED Strips: Addressable LED strips capable of displaying a wide range of colors and patterns.
* Ceiling Mounting Hardware: Initially considered for mounting the LED strips, later replaced with a panel with velcro for easier installation and flexibility.
* JST Connectors: Used for connecting and disconnecting components easily.
* Velcro: This serves as a versatile mounting solution for attaching the LED strips to a panel or surface. It offers flexibility and adjustability in the placement of the lighting components.

## Changes during the project ##

Originally, we planned to mount the LED strips on the ceiling however this was later changed and we decided to go with sticking the leds to a panel with velcro.
