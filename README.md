## What's our goal? ##

We were given the task to make lighting for a gaming room that users can interact with in different ways. This will affect the coloring and patern of the lighting.

## How does it work? ##

We use multiple led strips that are connected to the gaming setup and these will project different lighting paterns depending on what sound is made in the game you're playing. 

## Features ##



## Software we used ##

* Arduino
* Wled
* Fusion 360

## Hardware we used ##

* ESP32
* 24V voeding
* DC/DC Converter
* WS2812 Ledstrip
* Plafond Ophangoog
* JST Connector
* Straaldraad
* LedProfielen

## End conclusion ##

(eventuele problemen die we zijn tegengekomen, wat er beter kon, wat er goed was, ...)
